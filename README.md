The goal of pcodesOCHA is to scrap pcodes from [UNOCHA Common
Operational Datasets web
server](https://gistmaps.itos.uga.edu/arcgis/rest/services)

There is just one function exported: all\_pcodes\_feature\_servers Other
helper functions are available.

One function implemented partially to scrap geoJSON files:
scrap\_country\_geojson
