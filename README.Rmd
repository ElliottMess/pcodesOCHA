# pcodesOCHA

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pcodesOCHA is to scrap pcodes from [UNOCHA Common Operational Datasets web server](https://gistmaps.itos.uga.edu/arcgis/rest/services)

There is just one function exported: all_pcodes_feature_servers
Other helper functions are available.

One function implemented partially to scrap geoJSON files: scrap_country_geojson
